# Rucksack
I spent considerable time in Deutschland ðŸ‡© and you can't survive traveling around without a backpack.
Rucksack, as defined here, is a digital backpack.
It's my opinionated setup for traveling and migrating to new lands of software without losing sane context.

# Installation
`git clone https://github.com/rhettjay/ruck.git`

# How to use it
```bash
# Define an XDG_CONFIG_HOME
export XDG_CONFIG_HOME=$HOME/dotfiles

# Then copy everything over or source it in
source ~/$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/.zsh
```
