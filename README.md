# Rucksack
I spent considerable time in Deutschland ðŸ‡© and you can't survive traveling around without a backpack.
Rucksack, as defined here, is a digital backpack.
It's my opinionated setup for traveling and migrating to new lands of software without losing sane context.

# Installation
`git clone rucksack`

# How to use it
`ruck it`
`ruck setup`
`ruck update`

# Contributions
I intend on keeping this private and inviting a select few individuals, if that changes we'll update this.
