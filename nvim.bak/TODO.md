# TODO.md
This file's purpose is to give me a place to jot down issues I run into with my configuration (or discrepancies between machines).
The impetus is that I get busy writing code and forget to sharpen my axe every now and then. I need a place to keep track of issue basically.

[Fix]
- Autopairing when I add quotes "" regardless if something is already quoted I get autopaired.
  this should not be the case. I know there's some intelligent scanning going on and I need to fix it or write my own plugin to fix autopairing.
[Optimize]
[Deprecate]
[] jaybulk dir doesn't do anything useful. Can probably delete it or move this file into it...
[] fix tab to make sense on any machine
[x] fix remap of ,q for floating diagnostic
