# TODO.md
This file's purpose is to give me a place to jot down issues I run into with my configuration (or discrepancies between machines).
The impetus is that I get busy writing code and forget to sharpen my axe every now and then. I need a place to keep track of issue basically.

# [Fix]
- [ ] Autopairing when I add quotes "" regardless if something is already quoted I get autopaired.
  this should not be the case. I know there's some intelligent scanning going on and I need to fix it or write my own plugin to fix autopairing.
# [Optimize]
# [Deprecate]
- [ ] fix tab to make sense on any machine
- [ ] fix remap of ,q for floating diagnostic
the following need fixing:
auto formatting in typescript on the m1 Mac this seems to be when I write but no latency is caused
I need the ability to look up a class definition without leaving the current buffer such as on hover over
keep <leader><leader> as quick access to recently visited files. check on Mac m1.
